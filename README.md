# Towers-of-Hanoi

Introduction
The Towers of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can be slid onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a stack on one rod in increasing order of size, with the smallest disk at the top. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, following these rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
Each move consists of taking the top disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
The puzzle is often used to illustrate the concepts of recursion and algorithmic problem-solving.
